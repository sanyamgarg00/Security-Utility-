# Security-Utility-

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive security utility that includes four tools: a Port Scanner, SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanner, Vigenere Cipher Cryptography Machine, and Password Creator. These tools will allow users to scan for open ports, test for SQL injection vulnerabilities for the websites, encrypt and decrypt messages using Vigenere cipher, and generate strong passwords.

Port Scanner:
•	Allows the user to input a target IP address and a range of ports to scan
•	Scans for open ports on the specified IP address within the specified port range
•	Displays the results of the scan to the user

SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanner:
•	Allows the user to input a target URL
•	Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests to the target URL
•	Displays the results of the test to the user

Vigenere Cipher Cryptography Machine:
•	Allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenere Cipher algorithm. 
•	Takes a user-specified key and message as input 
•	Displays the encrypted or decrypted message to the user

Password Creator:
•	Allows the user to select a password complexity level (Easy, Medium, Complex) and length of the password.
•	Generates a strong password based on the selected complexity level
•	Copies the generated password to the user's clipboard for easy use
